# Adventure Game
## Introduction

This game was designed as a small end-of-training project. Although fairly basic, it enabled me to review all the basics of OOP classes. It consists of a fight between two protagonists.

Realizing the difficulties of approaching the graphical interface via a language like Python (with its Pygame library), I decided to stop the project in this language in order to migrate it to C#, which seems more suited to this style of project.

What's more, as this project was initiated at the very beginning of my apprenticeship, and in a totally organic way, I felt it necessary to redesign it from the outset, in a more structured way.

## System Requierement

Two Python Librairy : Pygame and TTKBootStrap

## How to run it

There are two ways to launch the game.

1° LAUNCHER.py: This opens a Tkinter window to create, delete or select a character. From this window, you can launch the game.

2° main.py: This launches the game with the last character played.

## In the future

I'm going to create a new repo in order to deposit the continuation of the game, coded in C#.
I'm looking for people who might be motivated to participate in the creation of this one, namely:
* A graphic designer
* A musician
* A storyteller
